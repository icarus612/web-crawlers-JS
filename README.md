# Web Crawlers Built in JavaScript

A place where I store any web crawlers I made in JavaScript. Origionally I was saiving each crawler as its own repo, but eventually I got tired of creating new projects that were all essentially the same, so now they are all stored here. (I will start making new branches for the new crawlers if I think they will take a long time.)

Feel free to use it and change it how you like - This operates under MIT licence.
